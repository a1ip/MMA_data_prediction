# MMA_data_prediction

#This project has two goals for me being new to data science: create a working web-scraper, play with and clean real world data,and learn machine learning algorithms. 

#These files will be split up into the webscraper, data cleaning, and then the machine learning/data visualization portions.

#There is also an interactive visualization of all of the Fight Stats (overall stats only at the moment). This can be run in the command line calling bokeh serve --show interactive_visualization_fighters.py. Make sure that the FightMetric_clean.csv is in the same folder as the python code and the same folder that you are running it from (or simply change the paths!)
